=== Keptn CNCF Incubator Project Proposal

*Name of Project:* keptn

*Description:*

Keptn is a control plane for continuous delivery and operations providing 
a declarative approach towards day 1 to day n operations of cloud-native
applications.

Keptn is built inspired by the framework used internally at Dynatrace which allows
us to run hundreds of production clusters without a dedicated operations team in
a fully automated "NoOps" approach.

Keptn solves the problem that traditional release pipelines are stitched together
by point-to-point integrations between a number of tools. The average
pipeline and operations automation toolchain consists of at least 7+ tools that
are integrated. The current approach of building toolchains comes with a number
of problems:

* Integrations are hard to maintain as they are spread across the entire
infrastructure.
* Onboarding a new service results in a lot of manual work for pipeline and
operations automation definition.
* Most toolchains today make it hard to define enterprise-wide best practices
for application delivery that can simply be applied across different
applications.

Keptn solves these problems by providing a configurable control plane to define
day 1 to day n operations. The design is inspired by SDN stacks:

* The application stack defines how the delivery and operations process should
work using a _shipyard file_. Shipyard files define stages, release strategies,
testing strategies, etc.
* Keptn then provides a control plane that manages a GitOps repository for the
stages defined in the _shipyard file_ as well as managing Kubernetes namespaces
and yaml files for services. Additionally, keptn uses a set of well-defined
lifecycle events for each potential event that services can subscribe to. All
events are defined as cloud events.
* The integration layer used knative services to connect the Keptn control plane
to all required tools to manage application delivery and operations. The
configuration which tools to use is defined in a keptn uniform file.

The approach of keptn has a number of advantages over traditional delivery pipelines and operation automation stacks:

* The behavior of a delivery and automation workflow can be easily changed and
is managed in a central repository.
* Using shipyard and uniform files decouples the "how" is  from the "what" which
enables greater flexibility in defining operational procedures.
* The declarative approach allows to even change automation at runtime without
any need for manual reconfiguration or touching tool integrations.

In the current version keptn focused on three major use cases for day 1 and day
2 operations:

* Declarative multistage delivery pipelines with automated quality gates.
_Uniform files_ allow creating any multi-stage pipeline including defining the
deployment strategy (e.g. direct, blue/green) and definition of testing strategy
for propagation.
* Deployment-based self-healing by automatically rolling back blue/green
deployment in case of problems without the need for manual intervention.
* Event-driven runbook automation for auto-remediation and self-healing at the
application level.

**Statement on alignment with CNCF mission:**

The Keptn project provides an easy and standardized way to deliver and operate
cloud-native applications. Kubernetes has massively simplified this process from
a platform perspective. Keptn provides the same simplicity at the application
level using a declarative approach to delivery and operations.

Keptn also builds on top of exiting CNCF projects:

- Kubernetes is used as the core runtime and deployment platform
- Envoy - and currently Istio - are used for traffic routing and deployment strategies (blue/green,
canary)
- Prometheus is used as a monitoring source
- Helm is used for deployment definition
- CloudEvents are the basis for all application lifecycle-related events

*Roadmap:*

* *March 2020 - v 0.6.1.* Latest version of Keptn supporting all core use cases
for delivery and operation automation. Quality Gates based on
SLIs/SLOs for differnt providers. Compatible with all major Kubernetes
distributions and used in 5+ production installations.  

* *Mai/June 2020 - v 0.7.0.* Improved GitOps-based Self-Healing support. Support
for manual approval workflows and cloud-native "release brackets". More UI
capabilities including release management and basic access control management. 

* *September 2020 - v 0.8.0.* Next generation lightweight choreography engine.
Ability to install delivery and control plane separately. Easy way to install
new services from online sources.

* *December 2020 - v 1.0.0.* Fully production ready version of Keptn used in a
large number of deployments.
